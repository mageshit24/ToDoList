# 📝 ToDoList — MERN Stack Application

A full-stack To-Do List app built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). Add tasks with a title, description, and deadline, edit or delete them anytime, and automatically see which tasks are **overdue** — all backed by a live REST API and a cloud-hosted MongoDB database.

## 🚀 Live Demo

🔗 **[ToDoList Web App](https://todolist-web-mern-project.netlify.app/)** — hosted on Netlify (frontend) + Render (backend)

---

## ✨ Features

- ➕ **Add Task** — create tasks with a title, description, and deadline (date + time)
- ✏️ **Edit Task** — update any task's details inline
- ❌ **Delete Task** — remove tasks with a confirmation prompt
- 📋 **View Tasks** — all tasks listed and auto-sorted by nearest deadline
- ⏰ **Overdue Detection** — the backend flags any incomplete task past its deadline
- ✅ **Completion Status** — tasks track a `completed` state
- 💬 **Inline Feedback** — success/error messages for every action

## 🔗 REST API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/todos` | Create a new task |
| `GET` | `/todos` | Get all tasks, sorted by deadline, with `isOverdue` computed |
| `PUT` | `/todos/:id` | Update a task by ID |
| `DELETE` | `/todos/:id` | Delete a task by ID |

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mageshit24/ToDoList.git
cd ToDoList
```

### 2. Backend setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:
```env
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=8000
```

Start the backend server:
```bash
node server.js
```
> The `start` script isn't defined in `package.json` yet — `node server.js` matches what the `Procfile` runs on Render. You can add `"start": "node server.js"` to the `scripts` block to enable `npm start` too.

The backend will run on **http://localhost:8000**.

### 3. Frontend setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
The frontend will run on **http://localhost:3000**.

> Note: `ToDo.js` currently points at the deployed Render API URL (`https://todolist-12qa.onrender.com/`). For local full-stack development, update the `apiUrl` constant to `http://localhost:8000/`.
